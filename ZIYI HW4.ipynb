    "The standard deviation tells us how much individual data points differ from the mean, showing the spread or variability in the dataset. It’s about how scattered the data is. The standard error of the mean tells us how accurate the sample mean is in estimating the true population mean. It decreases as the sample size gets larger, meaning the bigger the sample, the more reliable the mean. So, standard deviation is about the data’s spread, while the standard error is about how trustworthy the mean is"
